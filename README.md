⚖️ eCourts Cause List Scraper
Developed by Diksha Subhedar
📘 Project Overview

The eCourts Scraper is a Flask-based web application that allows users to fetch and download District Court cause lists directly from the official eCourts India system.
The app dynamically loads States, Districts, Court Complexes, and Courts using real eCourts APIs and generates a beautifully formatted PDF with court details and branding.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Dynamic dropdowns fetching real data from eCourts APIs
✅ Date-based cause list fetching for selected courts
✅ Automatic PDF generation and formatting using ReportLab & PyPDF2
✅ Clean layout with:

Blue header and court title

Indian Emblem logo (from static/emblem.png)

District, Complex, and Date details

Watermark: “Generated by Diksha Subhedar – eCourts Scraper”
✅ Backup data support (via data_backup.json) when API is unavailable

⚙️ Setup Instructions
🧩 1. Clone or Download the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecourts-scraper.git
cd ecourts-scraper

🐍 2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On Mac/Linux

📦 3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

🖼️ 4. Add Local Emblem Image

Place your emblem.png file inside the static/ folder.
You can use the official Emblem of India logo for authenticity.

▶️ Run the Application
python app.py


The app will start at:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

🌐 How It Works

Select State → District → Court Complex → Court Name → Date.

Click Fetch Cause List.

The app connects to the eCourts API and downloads the PDF.

If no data is available, it generates a clean, formatted fallback PDF.

The PDF includes:

Header with Emblem & title

Court details

Watermark “Generated by Diksha Subhedar – eCourts Scraper”

The final PDF is saved in /outputs with the naming pattern:

cause_list_<date>_annotated.pdf

💾 Sample Output

Example PDF Name:

outputs/cause_list_16-10-2025_annotated.pdf


Contains:

Blue Header Bar

Indian Emblem

“eCourts Cause List” title

District, Complex, and Date details

Watermark credit at bottom

🧠 Concepts Used

API Integration (REST requests via requests library)

Dynamic rendering with Flask routes

PDF generation (ReportLab canvas)

PDF overlay and merging (PyPDF2)

JSON data handling for API fallback
